	<h2>Gaming and Coding</h2>
	<h3>CSGO</h3>
	<p> CSGO, or Counter-Strike Global Offensive is a strategic first person shooter, and more importantly, one of the things that inspired me to get into coding. You may be wondering, how did a video game, of all things, inspire him to code. Well, CSGO requires customizing the UI, or User Interface. You do this by interacting with the Console. You give the console commands such as executables, XYZ values, RGB Values, and other such coding. I wanted to learn more and therefore, my interest in coding was born.
	<h3> JavaScript</h3>
	<p> In the 6th Grade and also in the 7th Grade, I was blessed with being in the ATM program and learning in great depth about coding, specifically JavaScript. I was in awe with all the things you could do with javascript and was inspired to look into it more and learn more. I then went into depth in lessons with Khan Academy and Code.Org. This would later be a good backbone for future coding.
	<h3> HTML and CSS</h3>
	In 8th Grade the ATM program provided what would soon be my favorite unit, HTML and CSS. I learned that HTML is basically the infrastructure and backbone of the code and CSS is the stylization and outer layer of the code. I would learn many skills within the next month from multiple sources, including but not limited to, Dash, Khan Academy, and Visual Studio Code. Eventually this Unit would end in a final project that is this very webpage.
