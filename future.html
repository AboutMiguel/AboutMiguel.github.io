		I hope to get into Millikan as I feel that they have a <br> very prestigious program (Quest) and they have a good social environment. <br> I researched various schools in choosing my high school and I found that Milikan<br> offerred the best of all aspects.

		<h3>College</h3>

		I hope to get into MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) as it is the ultimate school for people like me, the technologically inspired. Since I was a kid I remember hearing about college and the college MIT. When I realized I wanted to go into Computer Science I knew that my dream school would be MIT
		</p>
		
		<h3>Career Interests</h3>
		<p>
		I am interested in becoming a Coder, Beta Tester, Engineer, Medical Science, Technology within Music i.e. Studio worker. Possibly a Teacher. It all depends on the circumcision.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Goals</h3>
		<p>
		One of my biggest goals is to graduate as Valedictorian from High School (College too, I guess.) I want to graduate with a degree (if not Doctorate) in Computer Science. I also want to possibly get a degree in business.I also want to prove to the world that I can make a difference and that I am proficient if not excellent in Computer Science.
